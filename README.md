This project was to create a game of Rock Paper Scissors that was logged in the console.
The project will be updated at a later time to incorporate more items learn and make the game
function on a webpage. 

In this assignment I spend a lot of time learning functions in order to allow the game to run
smoothly. It is still not perfect as it runs through the five games as soon as it is started.
